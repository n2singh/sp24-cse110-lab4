1. The issue stemmed from treating the variables `num1` and `num2` as strings instead of numbers. Consequently, `num2` was concatenated to `num1` as a string literal, resulting in a concatenated string rather than a numerical sum.

2. In `fix.png` I have included the fixed code where to fix the code, we need to ensure that num1 and num2 are treated as numbers rather than strings when performing addition
